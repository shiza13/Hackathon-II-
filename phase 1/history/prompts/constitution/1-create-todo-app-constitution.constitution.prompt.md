## Prompt

Project: In-Memory Console-Based Todo Application
(Hackathon Phase I foundation for a multi-phase AI-powered system)

Core principles:
- Simplicity-first design (clear, beginner-friendly console experience)
- In-memory data integrity (no persistence in Phase I)
- Spec-driven development (features implemented strictly from requirements)
- Incremental extensibility (code structured to evolve into later phases)
- Readability and maintainability (clean, well-commented Python code)

Key standards:
- Language: Python (standard library only unless specified)
- Interface: Console-based (text input/output only)
- Data handling: In-memory storage (lists, dictionaries, or classes)
- No external databases, files, or APIs in Phase I
- All features must map directly to defined Todo requirements
- Clear separation of concerns (input handling, business logic, output)
- Error handling for invalid user input
- Code style: PEP 8 compliant
- Modular design to support future migration to:
  - Phase II: FastAPI + SQLModel + Neon DB
  - Phase III: AI-powered chatbot interface
  - Phase IV窶天: Containerized and cloud deployments
Constraints:
- Scope limited strictly to Phase I:
  - Create, view, update, delete Todo items
  - Mark todos as completed / pending
  - Display todos in a readable console format
- No file system persistence
- No web UI
- No AI features in Phase I
- Must run from terminal using Python only
- Single-user application

Success criteria:
- Application runs fully in memory without crashes
- All core Todo operations function correctly
- Console prompts are clear and user-friendly
- Codebase is clean, readable, and well-structured
- Ready to be extended into:
  - Phase II (Full-stack web app)
  - Phase III (AI-powered Todo chatbot)
  - Phase IV窶天 (Containerized and cloud deployments)

## Response snapshot

The constitution file `.specify/memory/constitution.md` has been created with the following content:

# In-Memory Console-Based Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity-First Design
Simplicity-first design with clear, beginner-friendly console experience. All features must be intuitive and easy to use for console-based interaction without unnecessary complexity.

### II. In-Memory Data Integrity
In-memory data integrity with no persistence in Phase I. All data handling occurs in memory using Python lists, dictionaries, or classes without file system or database persistence.

### III. Spec-Driven Development
Spec-driven development with features implemented strictly from requirements. All implementations must map directly to defined Todo requirements with clear acceptance criteria.

### IV. Incremental Extensibility
Incremental extensibility with code structured to evolve into later phases. Codebase must be clean, readable, and well-structured to support migration to Phase II (FastAPI + SQLModel + Neon DB), Phase III (AI-powered chatbot interface), and Phase IV-V (Containerized and cloud deployments).

### V. Readability and Maintainability
Readability and maintainability with clean, well-commented Python code. All code must follow PEP 8 standards, have clear separation of concerns (input handling, business logic, output), and include error handling for invalid user input.

### VI. Console-Based Interface
Console-based interface with text input/output only. The application must run from terminal using Python only with clear and user-friendly console prompts and readable display formats.

## Key Standards
- Language: Python (standard library only unless specified)
- Interface: Console-based (text input/output only)
- Data handling: In-memory storage (lists, dictionaries, or classes)

  - Phase II: FastAPI + SQLModel + Neon DB
  - Phase III: AI-powered chatbot interface
  - Phase IV窶天: Containerized and cloud deployments

## Scope Constraints

  - Create, view, update, delete Todo items
  - Mark todos as completed / pending
  - Display todos in a readable console format
- No file system persistence

## Governance
This constitution governs all development activities for the In-Memory Console-Based Todo Application. All code changes, feature implementations, and architectural decisions must align with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit documentation and approval. The constitution supersedes all other practices and serves as the ultimate authority for development decisions.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-02 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-02

## Outcome

- 笨 Impact: Constitution document created for the In-Memory Console-Based Todo Application with 6 core principles and governance structure
- 洫ｪ Tests: No tests required for this constitution creation
- 沒 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with new constitution content
- 沐 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with feature specification and implementation
- 洫 Reflection: The constitution clearly defines the scope, principles, and constraints for Phase I of the Todo application

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin with feature specification based on the constitution
